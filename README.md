# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using **MediaPipe Hands** and **OpenCV**. It detects and classifies hand gestures with high accuracy, making it suitable for applications like virtual controls, sign language interpretation, and more.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary programming language)
- **MediaPipe Hands** (Pre-trained model for hand tracking)
- **OpenCV** (For image processing and real-time video capture)
- **NumPy** (For numerical computations)


## 🎯 Features
✅ **Real-time hand tracking** using **MediaPipe**  
✅ **21 key points detection** per hand  
✅ **Supports multiple gestures**  
✅ **Optimized for speed and accuracy** (97.07% accuracy)  

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shravaniiiiii/hand-gesture-recognition.git
   cd hand-gesture-recognition
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the script in Pycharm**
